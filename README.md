# iOS-Code-Challenge

This challenge will be graded as if it were production ready code. Please make sure the work is your own. If any part of it is not, make sure it is properly cited.

## The Challenge
Develop a Swift App, to download and display contents of a list.

*Expected behavior:*

Upon launching the app, it should query this  [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AxxessTech/Mobile-Projects/master/challenge.json) , which will provide you the necessary content to populate the app in the JSON format.
Programmatically (no storyboards) create the user interface that allows the user to:
 
1. see all JSON fields
2. sort and display items based on their “type”
3. select an item to see it full screen.

*Bonus*
You don't necessarily need to do the following, but will be an add on to your project.
- Unit Testing / UI Testing
- Univeral interface support (iPhone & iPad)

## Requirements
There are no design requirements for this application, simply follow the iOS Human Interface Guidelines, however we strongly encourage you to add bells and whistles to set yourself apart and show off some of your skills.
Use of the following Cocoapods is required, but you may use additional pods if desired.

- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- [Snapkit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit)

## Evaluations
The code will be evaluated based on:
* Performance
* Code structure
* Object Oriented Programing
* Commenting
* iOS best practices

## Submission
You should provide a URL to a Git repository of yours when you complete. If it is a private repo on GitHub, you can add **MobileAxxess** account to your collaborators when complete.
